//Lab Exercise: Classes, Objects
/*This is a quick exercise to test your knowledge of classes and the concept of objects.

DESCRIPTION
Complete the following steps:

Launch your web development IDE of choice.
Fill in your JavaScript code in between the instruction numbers according to the step numbers below:
// Instruction 3 - create a new object
// (a), (b), (c)
// Instruction 4 - access object properties
// (a), (b), (c), (d)
// Instruction 5 - add to the map
// (a), (b), (c)
// Instruction 6 - iterate over the object
// (a), (b)
// Instruction 7 - manipulate the object
// (a), (b), (c), (d)

3. Create a new Object called darthVader and add the following key/value pairs to it:
    a) allegiance/Empire;
    b) weapon/lightsabre;
    c) sith/true (boolean value).

4. Access the properties that you have just declared by console-logging out the following details:
    a) The value of DarthVader's allegiance;
    b) The value of Darth Vader's weapon;
    c) The value of whether Darth Vader is a sith;
    d) The value of Jedi from Darth Vader (note Jedi may not exist; that is ok);
    e) The number of properties Darth Vader has (see the line of code below for this)
console.log(Object.keys(darthVader).length); 
Note: Object.keys is a function that takes an object and returns an array of the keys in it. By appending .length to it, we return the number of keys in the object.

5. Add key/value pairs to darthVader that:
    a) Sets a key of children to 2;
    b) Sets a key of childNames to the array ['Luke', 'Leia'];
    c) Console log the children property and the value of the first element in the childNames array.

6. For this step, perform the following:
    a) Iterate over darthVader using a for...in loop that uses both the key and the value of each pair;
    b) Then, console-logging out each pair.

7. Manipulate the object by:
    a) Changing the value of allegiance to The light side and console-log darthVader;
    b) Deleting the key/value pair children of darthVader and console-log darthVader. Hint: use the code below:
        delete darthVader.children;
    c) De-structuring the object, setting a variable for each of the keys in the object to the corresponding value in the object:
        let {allegiance, weapon, sith, childNames} = darthVader;
    d) Lastly, clearing the darthVader object and console log it.*/
