Front End - React
* Besides React, what other JavaScript libraries do you need?
I would need a testing library, such as Jest to ensure that my app works as expected. While it is not always done by developers, testing is recommended to make sure you have a quality app that runs as you want it to. 
I would also like to use jQuery Mobile in order to create a responsive user interface system as suggested in the video. As developers, we should understand how to make responsive layouts and this library can help. 
The full-stack react framework NextJS seems very useful since it has become very popular so there will be a lot of support for its file-based routing and data fetching. So I would try to use that framework.
