Front End - React
* Besides React, what other JavaScript libraries do you need?
I would need a testing library, such as Jest to ensure that my app works as expected. While it is not always done by developers, testing is recommended to make sure you have a quality app that runs as you want it to. 
I would also like to use jQuery Mobile in order to create a responsive user interface system as suggested in the video. As developers, we should understand how to make responsive layouts and this library can help. 
The full-stack react framework NextJS seems very useful since it has become very popular so there will be a lot of support for its file-based routing and data fetching. So I would try to use that framework. 

Backend - Service
* Language?
I would use Node.js language because it can be useful to use one language in both front-end and back-end needs. Considering that the notes app is currently just text-based, node.js is perfect. If we wanted to allow users to start adding videos or more complicated notes, I would use a different server-side language. 
* Framework? 
As I am considering using node.js, I would use a framework such as Express or Fastify as they work well with node.js. Express is the most popular and makes it easy to integrate other packages. 
* How are you going to connect to your database? 
I would connect my database using MongoDB because this works very well with Express. Also, since I feel comfortable with JSON-like documents, MongoDB is a good option.

Backend - database
* Relational or NoSQL? Why?
I would want to use noSQL because it is more flexible since it can store both structured and unstructured data.
