## React Quiz #7: Tech Stack Selection
After watching the video, complete this assignment. 

### Description
We will piggy back off your previous Homework Assignment #8: To-Do List with TypeScript, which involves the creation of a To-Do List app on your localhost computer. We want you to make some design choices in this assignment to host and power that application. Specifically, think about which tech stacks you would use to take this app from your localhost computer to production. There are more than one ways to address this challenge in computer science. Pick your choices and justify them!

### Additional Notes
In a typical software, or web application in our case, we can draw up a software boundary surrounding its capabilities by dividing them into 2 very rough domains:
<ul>
    <li>Frontend, which is often termed the presentation layer</li>
    <li>Backend, which often consists of web services, APIs, database/data stores and all of their infrastructure components (cache, load balancers, gateways, etc on different network layers).</li>
</ul>
The backend service layer is also termed middleware but for brevity, we will call it Backend Service here. 

### Instructions
You will write out a list of technology choices (frameworks, libraries, plugins, etc), as you learned from this week's lecture, to build out your To-Do app, from frontend to backend perspectives. For each tech stack, you will focus on its WHAT and WHY, namely:
<ul>
    <li>What it is? </li>
    <li>Why do you need it? </li>
</ul>
Please fill out the following question template with your answers, and submit it in the text submission box.

### Q & A Template
<code>Front End - React</code>
* Besides React, what other JavaScript libraries do you need?
* For each library, explain why you need it? 

<code>Backend - Service</code>
* Language?
* Framework? 
* How are you going to connect to your database? 

<code>Backend - Database</code>
* Relational or NoSQL? Why?
